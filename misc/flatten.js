/**
 * Line 12 may make this function seem like itâ€™s O(n^2) - we have a for-loop inside a for-loop, which usually results in O(n^2).
 * However, the inner loop only processes what the outer loop skips over.\
 * For example, take the array [1, 2, [3, 4, 5], 6, 7]. The outer array only has 5 elements in it:

1
2
[3, 4, 5]
6
7
This means the outer forEach loop will essentially skip over 3, 4, and 5, leaving the inner for-loop to deal with those.

The final time complexity is:

O(n)
because the inner and outer loops operate on different items. No item is processed twice.
