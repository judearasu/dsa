#### Problem 1

Write a function that accepts a 2D array of integer pixels (W x H) which represents an image, a threshold T and a number N.
The function should return a collection of size N of the pixels in the image which exceed the threshold T given.
The pixels must be chosen randomly such that repeated calls to the function return different sets.
